HTML form data uploaded in MySQL  by PHP file with help of JavaScript

Hi, This is Anmol Singh.

Today, I am going to upload form data through a PHP file with help of Vanilla JS AJEX, Without Reloading the Page.

There is Two PHP file in the repository first one is Index.php and dataBase.php, once you gaze at this file, all things inside them, start to become words,
with meaning and grace. Hope you enjoy it.

First, I want to share some experiences.
I see many people use JQuery, everywhere. Anywhere, there is some requirement of JS.
Their is no problem, because they know what they are doing. Ploblem comes, when someone like ME, who is new or willing to learn Web Deploment,
and have to seek their coad for perposs, he copy the code and its works fine, but he didnt able to understand how the piece of this coad doing that job.

So, if you are new like me, I segest you to use Vanilla JS as much as you can.
Vanilla JS, is not anything Spacel, its the core JS or simply what you call javaScript.

For Vanilla JS, you don't need any CDN it's embedded in almost every web browser.

And Most importantly,
Vanilla JS or JavaScript is a programming language.
And jsFrameworks are a set of libraries that use Vanilla JS as core and Comes in existence with some purpose in the Creator's Mind.
